NAME
    Data::FormValidator::ErrMsgs::JavaScript - Let JavaScript handle DFV
    error presentation.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::FormValidator::ErrMsgs::JavaScript (qw/&dfv_js_error_msgs/);

     # In a DFV profile:
     msgs => \&dfv_js_error_msgs,

    Now your error messages will come out like this:

     <script type="text/javascript">dfv_error_msg('field_name');</script>

FUNCTIONS
  dfv_js_error_msgs
    See SYNOPSIS above for syntax.

    It's up to you define the "dfv_error_msg" function in JavaScript to do
    something interesting.

    This function respects the following "msgs" configuration directives,
    which are documented more in Data::FormValidator:

     prefix
     any_errors

    Of course, these can't be set directly in the profile anymore because
    the callback is there. They can still be set through the defaults system
    documented in Data::FormValidator.

LIMITATIONS
    More detail could be passed through to the JavaScript function about the
    failure. This may change in the future, perhaps in an incompatible way.

    It is not currently possible to use a format string other than the one
    provided.

    Workarounds included sending a patch or using this routine as the basis
    for your own.

    That workaround might look like this:

     msgs => dfv_js_error_msgs({
        format => 'foo: %';
     });

    A closure could then be created which passing in the arguments you want.

FUTURE
    If you like this extension to Data::FormValidator, give me some feedback
    on the Data::FormValidator list and we'll work out a stable interface.
